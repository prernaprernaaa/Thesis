Abstract:
We study the dynamics of networks of coupled neurons, modelled by the discrete two-dimensional Rulkov map. This map can mimic different activity regimes of a single biological neuron, ranging from silent to spiking and bursting behaviour. First, we consider the dynamics of two coupled identical neurons and two non-identical neurons and explore the effects of different coupling strengths on the activity of this coupled system. The analysis is then extended to neurons coupled in larger networks of different topologies. In particular, we investigate the impact of external perturbations, as well as heterogeneity in the intrinsic behaviour of the constituent neurons, on spatiotemporal pattern formation in the network.
